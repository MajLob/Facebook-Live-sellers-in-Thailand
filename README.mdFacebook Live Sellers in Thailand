## Dataset Overview
status_id: Unique identifier for each Facebook post.
num_reactions: Total number of reactions (likes, loves, etc.).
num_comments: Number of comments.
num_shares: Number of shares.
num_likes: Number of likes.
num_loves: Number of "love" reactions.
num_wows, num_hahas, num_sads, num_angrys: Counts for each reaction type.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook covers data exploration through:
1. Descriptive Statistics and Box Plots: Summary statistics and box plots highlight distribution, ranges, and outliers across engagement metrics.
2. Correlation Analysis: A correlation heatmap reveals relationships among reactions, comments, and shares.
3. Clustering and PCA: Clustering (using K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA) are applied to uncover patterns in user engagement.

## Data Conclusions
Through dimensionality reduction and clustering, several engagement patterns were observed:
1. Optimal Clustering Reveals Audience Segments: Using the Elbow Method in K-Means, an optimal cluster count is identified, showing distinct segments of posts based on engagement metrics. These clusters represent various levels and types of engagement (high comments, high reactions, etc.), valuable for targeting audience preferences.
2. Dominance of Positive Reactions: The dataset shows that "likes" and "loves" dominate, indicating positive user sentiment during live-selling sessions. This suggests that users generally respond favorably to live-selling content.
3. Engagement Profiles: Clusters created from metrics such as num_reactions and num_comments indicate distinct engagement profiles. Some clusters represent highly interactive content (many comments), while others reflect broad reach (high shares), highlighting different forms of post effectiveness.
